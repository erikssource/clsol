Command Line Solitaire

My first program written in Rust. If you are looking for a good example of Rust best practices, this is not the place to look. The code is currently a bit of a mess, but I hope to improve things as a learn Rust and clean things up.

This is a pretty basic version of solitaire with cards drawn from the stock one at a time with unlimited pass-throughs. I plan on making it better with more options as time goes on.
